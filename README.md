# tptkeys2

A new, updated version of the old TPTKeys tool.

Displays all keyboard shortcuts for [The Powder Toy][TPT]. 

Currently live on http://boxmein.net/tpt/tptkeys/ . 

## Usage

Click on any black key to display its associated key shortcuts in the 
description box. 

Key shortcuts are described in JSON on another page.

## SVG

The SVG file is based on [Qwerty.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Qwerty.svg) by [User:Mysid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mysid) but 
has been *heavily* modified and optimized. 

You may use it in your projects, but you have to credit both me and Mysid, as 
well as release your own derived version under the 
[CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) 
license.

## Technologies

The page is loosely based on the HTML5 Boilerplate, but it requires much less 
boilerplate code, which was simply pruned.
